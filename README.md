# Keyhorde-42.5
Babby's first bad keyboard PCB

This is a not-quite 40%, not-quite 50% keyboard being made for the founding members of Keyhorde with the following layout:
![An 11-key-wide, four-row-tall compact keyboard somwhere between a standard 40% and 50% layout](https://github.com/rynehager/Keyhorde-42.5/blob/main/keyboard-layout.png)

The purpose is to design a compact, USB Type-C keyboard with a Gingham-type PCB aesthetic and a layout that doesn't interfere with general blogging, including commonly used punctuation, but which is also as portable as possible and generally compatible with keyset options â€” i.e., it does not require custom or incorrect legend keys when using a set with wide compatibility. 

Schematics and layout designed in KiCAD, licensing CC0 so feel free to reuse, remix, make, sell, etc. whatever you dig bby just don't hold me responsible.
